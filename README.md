# Diabetes_Predication_Classification
This repository provides a detailed exploratory data analysis of the PIMA Diabetes Dataset, using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The analysis focuses on understanding data characteristics and feature relationships.

   **Contents:**

   * Data loading and preprocessing
   * Descriptive statistics of features
   * Visualization of feature distributions (histograms)
   * Correlation analysis (heatmap)
   * Analysis of the relationship between features and the 'Outcome' variable

   **Next Steps:**
The insights gained from this EDA can inform the development of predictive models. Common classification algorithms suitable for this type of problem include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM). These are not implemented in this notebook but are logical extensions of this work.

   **Technologies Used:**

   * Python
   * Pandas
   * NumPy
   * Seaborn
   * Matplotlib
